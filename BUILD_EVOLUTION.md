# WHEELIE Build & Evolution Roadmap

This guide helps new users and contributors follow the build process and understand the evolution of the WHEELIE robot project.

## 1. Getting Started

- Begin with `START_HERE.md` for setup instructions and project orientation.
- Review `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for architecture and goals.

## 2. Hardware Assembly

- Follow step-by-step guides in `docs/assembly/` for pin mapping, wiring, and hardware setup.
- Reference shopping lists and setup guides for required components.

## 3. Sensor Integration & Calibration

- Use sensor guides in `docs/sensors/` (e.g., MPU6050, VL53L0X) for wiring, calibration, and troubleshooting.
- Apply calibration routines and best practices as described in each guide.

## 4. Software & Firmware

- Explore the `src/` and `include/` folders for source code and integration logic.
- Build and upload firmware using PlatformIO (`platformio.ini` for configuration).
- Run tests in the `tests/` folder to validate hardware and software.

## 5. Evolution & Change Tracking

- Check the `Changelog/` folder for weekly and monthly updates, new features, and bug fixes.
- Each changelog file summarizes what changed, why, and links to relevant guides or code.

## 6. Advanced Features & Best Practices

- Read advanced guides in `docs/` for mission control, mapping, web dashboard, and swarm communication.
- Follow integration best practices for safety, navigation, and sensor fusion.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Support

- Use troubleshooting sections in each guide and test files for diagnostics.
- Refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for collaboration and support channels.
